      <description>Introduction It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I started developing reactive-react-redux and react-tracked. These libraries provide so called state usage tracking to optimize render in React. This approach, I think, is pretty novel and quite a lot of my effort has been put to improve its performance.
Lately, I thought it would be nicer if this can be used more broadly. I wondered if it can be used in vanilla JS. What would be an API in vanilla JS?</description>

      <description>Introduction Redux is a framework-agnostic library for global state. It&amp;rsquo;s often used with React.
While I like the abstraction of Redux, React will introduce Concurrent Mode in the near future. If we want to get benefit of useTransition, state must be inside React to allow state branching. That means we can&amp;rsquo;t get the benefit with Redux.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been developing React Tracked for global state that allows state branching. It works well in Concurrent Mode.</description>

      <description>Introduction Developing with React hooks is fun for me. I have been developing several libraries. The very first library was a library for global state. It&amp;rsquo;s naively called &amp;ldquo;react-hooks-global-state&amp;rdquo; which turns out to be too long to read.
The initial version of the library was published in Oct 2018. Time has passed since then, I learned a lot, and now v1.0.0 of the library is published.

      <description>Introduction It is said that Redux has been overused in some use cases and React context+hooks plays well in such use cases. While I agree with it, Redux should work well in some other situations. Redux should help developing larger apps with many developers. Various libraries in Redux ecosystem should accelerate development. There&amp;rsquo;s another situation in which Redux may help, and that is Web Workers.

      <description>Motivation I love Redux. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I like all parts of Redux ecosystem. Some people dislike Redux because of its boilerplate code. That&amp;rsquo;s sad. Boilerplate code is not from the Redux core, but from the ecosystem. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong. Best practices are nice and I think the recent work of Redux Starter Kit is great. (Claps to Mark)
I think I have my own understanding of how to use Redux with React.</description>

      <description>Introduction I have been developing several React hooks libraries for months. In this post, I will explain why and how I developed a React Redux binding library with React hooks. The library is implemented to be concurrent mode friendly. Let&amp;rsquo;s discuss why it&amp;rsquo;s important and what&amp;rsquo;s the technique behind it.
React concurrent mode has not come yet, and all discussions are based on the current unstable behavior. Please note that when concurrent mode is released and best practice is researched, things may change.</description>

      <description>Introduction React useContext is very handy to avoid prop drilling. It can be used to define global state or shared state that multiple components in the tree can access.
However, useContext is not specifically designed for global state and there&amp;rsquo;s a caveat. Any change to context value propagates all useContext to re-render components.
This post shows some example code about the problem and the solution with state usage tracking.
Problem Let&amp;rsquo;s assume a person object as a state.</description>

      <description>Introduction There are many libraries for global state with React hooks. React Redux also provides hooks API, which is very clean.
In general, I would avoid using global state. It would reduce the isolation of components. Multiple contexts should work fine for certain use cases.
But, what if we really need a global state.
Problem When a state is a non-trivial object, it&amp;rsquo;s not likely to use all properties of the object for one component to render.</description>

      <description>Introduction Since React hooks landed, there has been many libraries proposed for global state. Some of them are simple wrappers around context. Whereas, some of them are full featured state management systems.
Technically, there are several implementations how to store state and notify changes. We don&amp;rsquo;t go in detail in this post, but just note two axes.
 whether context based or external store whether subscriptions based or context propagation  In this post, we focus on API design of hooks at the consumer end.</description>

      <description>Introduction React-Redux provides hooks API with nice abstraction. Especially, useSelector is probaly less misused than mapStateToProps.
react-tracked is a library for global state without Redux. This library provides almost compatible hooks API to React-Redux. It&amp;rsquo;s developed with performance in mind, and it should be as performant as React-Redux, even though it utilizes only React context. See the GitHub repo for more information.

This post shows benchmark results to convince that it actually is performant in one scenario.</description>

      <description>Introduction If you had already used Redux and loved it, you might not understand why people try using React context and hooks to replace Redux (a.k.a no Redux hype). For those who would think Redux DevTools Extension and middleware are nice to have, Redux and context + hooks are actually two options. Context + hooks is just fine to share state among components, however if apps get bigger, they are likely to require Redux or other similar solutions; otherwise they end up having many contexts that can&amp;rsquo;t be handled very easily.</description>

      <title>Four patterns for global state with React hooks: Context or Redux</title>

      <description>Introduction Global state or shared state is one of the biggest issues when you start developing a React app. Should we use Redux? Do hooks provide a Redux-like solution? I would like to show four patterns toward using Redux. This is my personal opinion and mainly for new apps.
Pattern 1: Prop passing Some might think it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t scale, but the most basic pattern should still be prop passing. If the app is small enough, define local state in a parent component and simply pass it down to child components.</description>

      <description>Introduction Recently, React Redux released hooks API. It&amp;rsquo;s v7.1.0-alpha.4 as of writing.
https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/releases/tag/v7.1.0-alpha.4
On the other hand, I&amp;rsquo;ve been developing a new React Redux binding library with hooks and Proxy.
https://github.com/dai-shi/reactive-react-redux
It&amp;rsquo;s time to benchmark both of them to have better understanding in performance. The reactive-react-redux library utilizes Proxy to auto-detect state usage, hence it technically has overhead which would affect performance. We would like to learn how much it will be affected in a realistic example.</description>

      <title>New React Redux coding style with hooks without selectors</title>
      <link>https://blog.axlight.com/posts/new-react-redux-coding-style-with-hooks-without-selectors/</link>

      <description>Introduction React Redux is one of popular web tech stacks. As I found React hooks so promising, I have been developing a hooks-based library for React Redux called &amp;ldquo;reactive-react-redux.&amp;rdquo;
https://github.com/dai-shi/reactive-react-redux
Coding style using this library is mentally different from the official react-redux. Thanks to Proxy, developers don&amp;rsquo;t need to care about optimization, but just focus on composition of logic.
This library provides two basic hooks: useReduxState and useReduxDispatch. This article shows example code how to use them.</description>

      <title>Developing React custom hooks for Redux without react-redux</title>

      <description>Background Ever since I learned Redux, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking an alternative integration of react and redux to the official react-redux library. The intuition behind it is that Redux is super simple which I like a lot, whereas react-redux is complex because of performance tuning. If you are developing a business product, the official react-redux is to go without a doubt, but if you are playing with creating a toy app or you are just starting learning Redux, you might want something more straightforward.</description>

      <description>There is a follow-up article which describes the implementation details of this library. Please visit here.
 Redux is one of the popular libraries for React. Although Redux itself is not tied to React, it&amp;rsquo;s often used with the official bindings react-redux that allows to connect Redux state to any React components.
In this article, we propose another bindings library to combine React and Redux. This library tries to be simple and easy for beginners.</description>

      <description>In this article, I will first explain minimal code to implement global state with useReducer and useContext which are called &amp;ldquo;hooks&amp;rdquo; that will be available in React 16.7. I will then compare it with react-hooks-global-state which is a tiny library that I&amp;rsquo;ve been developing for global state management primarily for small applications.
Note: Global state is convenient for sharing values among components far apart in the component tree, but it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be abused because it would limit the reusability.</description>

      <description>The library I&amp;rsquo;ve been developing a library to make use of React Hooks API. The library is for global state mangement with the aim to use it instead of Redux, especially for smaller applications. See the repository for more information and the source code.
https://github.com/dai-shi/react-hooks-global-state
Please also check out my previous posts [1] [2].
Support for Redux middleware Originally, the library was extending useState for global state. Later, reducer is supported.</description>

      <description>Motivation Everyone is excited about the new React Hooks API. So am I. Having been thinking how to manage global state, the Hooks API seems promising. By the way, I like Redux a lot, but I don&amp;rsquo;t like react-redux a.k.a connect very much. It is too complicated for beginners to use it properly. For example, reselect / memoization is a hard concept to explain. My recommendation is to structure a global state so that mapStateToProps only needs to select a part of the state without any logic.</description>
