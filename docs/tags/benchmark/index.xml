      <description>Introduction React-Redux provides hooks API with nice abstraction. Especially, useSelector is probaly less misused than mapStateToProps.
react-tracked is a library for global state without Redux. This library provides almost compatible hooks API to React-Redux. It&amp;rsquo;s developed with performance in mind, and it should be as performant as React-Redux, even though it utilizes only React context. See the GitHub repo for more information.

This post shows benchmark results to convince that it actually is performant in one scenario.</description>

      <description>Introduction Recently, React Redux released hooks API. It&amp;rsquo;s v7.1.0-alpha.4 as of writing.

On the other hand, I&amp;rsquo;ve been developing a new React Redux binding library with hooks and Proxy.
https://github.com/dai-shi/reactive-react-redux
It&amp;rsquo;s time to benchmark both of them to have better understanding in performance. The reactive-react-redux library utilizes Proxy to auto-detect state usage, hence it technically has overhead which would affect performance. We would like to learn how much it will be affected in a realistic example.</description>
