      <description>Introduction It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I started developing reactive-react-redux and react-tracked. These libraries provide so called state usage tracking to optimize render in React. This approach, I think, is pretty novel and quite a lot of my effort has been put to improve its performance.
Lately, I thought it would be nicer if this can be used more broadly. I wondered if it can be used in vanilla JS. What would be an API in vanilla JS?</description>
