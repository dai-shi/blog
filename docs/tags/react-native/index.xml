      <description>This article shows the steps to create a minimal Expo project. The project uses TypeScript and Jest. Note that this procedure is based on Expo SDK31 and may be invalid in the future.
Install Expo CLI As described in the official doc, let&amp;rsquo;s install the CLI tool.
$ npm install -g expo-cli Note: I prefer using npx and I use npx in my project, but expo-cli depends on @expo/dev-tools which depends on old graphql.</description>

      <description>Motivation Have you heard of React Native, GraphQL and TypeScript? I&amp;rsquo;m looking for a easy and nice tech stack to develop mobile apps. These three may fit nicely for developing mobile apps for beginners up to intermediates. More precisely, Expo is chosen for building React Native development environment, and React Apollo is for GraphQL. These libraries comes with type annotations, which allow us to code in TypeScript. By &amp;ldquo;Clean&amp;rdquo; I mean not only the boilerplate is minimalistic, but also we don&amp;rsquo;t allow &amp;ldquo;any&amp;rdquo; types.</description>
