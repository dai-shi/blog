      <description>Introduction It is said that Redux has been overused in some use cases and React context+hooks plays well in such use cases. While I agree with it, Redux should work well in some other situations. Redux should help developing larger apps with many developers. Various libraries in Redux ecosystem should accelerate development. There&amp;rsquo;s another situation in which Redux may help, and that is Web Workers.
A while back, Surma posted a nice blog post: React + Redux + Comlink = Off-main-thread</description>

      <description>Introduction React context and useContext are very handy. You would have no problem using it while developing a small app. If the size of your app became non-trivial, you might experience some performance issues with regard to useContext. This is because useContext will trigger rerender whenever the context value is changed. This happens even if the part of the value is not used in render. This is by design. If useContext were to conditionally trigger rerenders, the hook would become non-composable.</description>

      <description>Motivation I love Redux. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I like all parts of Redux ecosystem. Some people dislike Redux because of its boilerplate code. That&amp;rsquo;s sad. Boilerplate code is not from the Redux core, but from the ecosystem. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong. Best practices are nice and I think the recent work of Redux Starter Kit is great. (Claps to Mark)
I think I have my own understanding of how to use Redux with React.</description>

      <description>Introduction I have been developing several React hooks libraries for months. In this post, I will explain why and how I developed a React Redux binding library with React hooks. The library is implemented to be concurrent mode friendly. Let&amp;rsquo;s discuss why it&amp;rsquo;s important and what&amp;rsquo;s the technique behind it.
React concurrent mode has not come yet, and all discussions are based on the current unstable behavior. Please note that when concurrent mode is released and best practice is researched, things may change.</description>

      <description>Introduction React useContext is very handy to avoid prop drilling. It can be used to define global state or shared state that multiple components in the tree can access.
However, useContext is not specifically designed for global state and there&amp;rsquo;s a caveat. Any change to context value propagates all useContext to re-render components.
This post shows some example code about the problem and the solution with state usage tracking.</description>

      <description>Introduction React hooks have changed the way to compose components. This post will show an example which is very hooks-oriented.
We use two libraries: react-tracked and immer. While immer makes it easy to update state in an immutable way, react-tracked makes it easy to read state with tracking for optimization. Please check out the repo for more details.

      <description>Introduction There are many libraries for global state with React hooks. React Redux also provides hooks API, which is very clean.
In general, I would avoid using global state. It would reduce the isolation of components. Multiple contexts should work fine for certain use cases.
But, what if we really need a global state.
Problem When a state is a non-trivial object, it&amp;rsquo;s not likely to use all properties of the object for one component to render.</description>

      <description>Introduction There are many libraries to provide global state in React. React itself doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide such a feature, probably because separation of concerns is important and having global state naively is not idiomatic. However, in certain cases, having global state is good as long as it&amp;rsquo;s properly implemented. It&amp;rsquo;s likely that performance drops down compared to using non-global state (incl. multiple contexts).
This post introduces a library for global state with performance.</description>

      <description>Introduction If you had already used Redux and loved it, you might not understand why people try using React context and hooks to replace Redux (a.k.a no Redux hype). For those who would think Redux DevTools Extension and middleware are nice to have, Redux and context + hooks are actually two options. Context + hooks is just fine to share state among components, however if apps get bigger, they are likely to require Redux or other similar solutions; otherwise they end up having many contexts that can&amp;rsquo;t be handled very easily.</description>

      <title>Four patterns for global state with React hooks: Context or Redux</title>

      <description>Introduction Global state or shared state is one of the biggest issues when you start developing a React app. Should we use Redux? Do hooks provide a Redux-like solution? I would like to show four patterns toward using Redux. This is my personal opinion and mainly for new apps.
Pattern 1: Prop passing Some might think it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t scale, but the most basic pattern should still be prop passing. If the app is small enough, define local state in a parent component and simply pass it down to child components.</description>

      <description>Background Ever since I learned Redux, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking an alternative integration of react and redux to the official react-redux library. The intuition behind it is that Redux is super simple which I like a lot, whereas react-redux is complex because of performance tuning. If you are developing a business product, the official react-redux is to go without a doubt, but if you are playing with creating a toy app or you are just starting learning Redux, you might want something more straightforward.</description>

      <description>There is a follow-up article which describes the implementation details of this library. Please visit here.
 Redux is one of the popular libraries for React. Although Redux itself is not tied to React, it&amp;rsquo;s often used with the official bindings react-redux that allows to connect Redux state to any React components.
In this article, we propose another bindings library to combine React and Redux. This library tries to be simple and easy for beginners.</description>

      <description>In this article, I will first explain minimal code to implement global state with useReducer and useContext which are called &amp;ldquo;hooks&amp;rdquo; that will be available in React 16.7. I will then compare it with react-hooks-global-state which is a tiny library that I&amp;rsquo;ve been developing for global state management primarily for small applications.
Note: Global state is convenient for sharing values among components far apart in the component tree, but it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be abused because it would limit the reusability.</description>

      <description>Note: this post has nothing to do with React Hooks API.
In my previous post, I introduced a library called react-context-global-state. After a while, I have better knowlege of TypeScript (yes, I&amp;rsquo;m a beginner!), and come up with fairly good type definitions. I just released a new version.
https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-context-global-state
Example code in TypeScript Let me breifly show how the code looks like in TypeScript.
In a file named state.ts, we define a global state and export function components.</description>

Please also check out my previous posts [1] [2].
Support for Redux middleware Originally, the library was extending useState for global state. Later, reducer is supported.</description>

      <description>Motivation Everyone is excited about the new React Hooks API. So am I. Having been thinking how to manage global state, the Hooks API seems promising. By the way, I like Redux a lot, but I don&amp;rsquo;t like react-redux a.k.a connect very much. It is too complicated for beginners to use it properly. For example, reselect / memoization is a hard concept to explain. My recommendation is to structure a global state so that mapStateToProps only needs to select a part of the state without any logic.</description>

      <description>React Hooks API is a new proposal for React v16.7. It enables writing all components as functions with full functionality. You can develop &amp;ldquo;custom hooks&amp;rdquo; to add a new functionality. Although it&amp;rsquo;s not released yet, I would like to introduce a new library to support global state. Note that it&amp;rsquo;s still an experiment.
The library It&amp;rsquo;s called &amp;ldquo;react-hooks-global-state&amp;rdquo; and is available in npm. Please also checkout the GitHub repository.</description>

      <description>I had been trying to find a way to use React without using class. Redux is one solution to achieve this. Although I love the idea of writing everthing in pure functions, Redux is sometimes not suitable for small apps. React v16.3 introduced new Context API officially. Since then, several ideas were proposed to use it for managing global state. So far, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to find something I really liked, hence I made a new one.</description>
