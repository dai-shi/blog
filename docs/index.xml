      <description>Introduction It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I started developing reactive-react-redux and react-tracked. These libraries provide so called state usage tracking to optimize render in React. This approach, I think, is pretty novel and quite a lot of my effort has been put to improve its performance.
Lately, I thought it would be nicer if this can be used more broadly. I wondered if it can be used in vanilla JS. What would be an API in vanilla JS?</description>

      <title>Developing React Global State Library With Atom Abstraction</title>
      <link>https://blog.axlight.com/posts/developing-react-global-state-library-with-atom-abstraction/</link>

      <description>Introduction I have been developing various global state libraries for React. For example:
 react-tracked react-hooks-global-state  My main motivation is to eliminate selector functions that are only required for render optimization. Render optimization here means it avoids extra re-renders. An extra re-render is a re-render process that produces the same view result as before.
Since Recoil is announced, I&amp;rsquo;m very interested in atom abstraction because it eliminates selector functions for render optimization and the API seems pretty intuitive.</description>

      <description>Introduction Redux is a framework-agnostic library for global state. It&amp;rsquo;s often used with React.
While I like the abstraction of Redux, React will introduce Concurrent Mode in the near future. If we want to get benefit of useTransition, state must be inside React to allow state branching. That means we can&amp;rsquo;t get the benefit with Redux.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been developing React Tracked for global state that allows state branching. It works well in Concurrent Mode.</description>

      <description>Introduction Developing with React hooks is fun for me. I have been developing several libraries. The very first library was a library for global state. It&amp;rsquo;s naively called &amp;ldquo;react-hooks-global-state&amp;rdquo; which turns out to be too long to read.
The initial version of the library was published in Oct 2018. Time has passed since then, I learned a lot, and now v1.0.0 of the library is published.

      <description>Introduction This is a short post about my small library.
Apollo Client is a library for GraphQL. Apollo Link is an interface to extend Apollo Client.
Typically, you would initialize apollo client like this.
import { ApolloClient } from &amp;#39;apollo-client&amp;#39;; import { InMemoryCache } from &amp;#39;apollo-cache-inmemory&amp;#39;; import { HttpLink } from &amp;#39;apollo-link-http&amp;#39;; const cache = new InMemoryCache(); const link = new HttpLink({ uri }); const client = new ApolloClient({ cache: cache, link: link, }); I want to define the link in another file and lazy load it, because it is not an HttpLink but a complicated large link.</description>

      <description>Introduction I have been developing React Tracked, which is a library for global state with React Hooks and Context.
https://react-tracked.js.org
This is a small library and focuses on only one thing. It optimizes re-renders using state usage tracking. More technically, it uses Proxies to detect the usage in render, and only triggers re-renders if necessary.
Because of that, the usage of React Tracked is very straightforward. It is just like the normal useContext.</description>

      <description>Introduction React released Concurrent Mode in the experimental channel and Suspense for Data Fetching. This release is for library authors, and not for production apps yet. The new data fetching pattern proposed is called Render-as-You-Fetch.
This post mainly discuss Render-as-You-Fetch for basic fetch calls, like calling REST APIs. But, some of discussions are not limited to REST. One could invoke GraphQL endpoints with simple fetch calls. For more complex use cases with GraphQL, it&amp;rsquo;s worth looking into Relay documentation too.</description>

      <description>Introduction I have been developing a React Hooks library called React Tracked. This is the library I put much effort lately as well as my other libraries.
https://github.com/dai-shi/react-tracked
This library solves a performance issue with React Context. For those who are interested in the fundamental problem, please take a look at the long issue.
What&amp;rsquo;s notable in this library is that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide any new fancy features. You can simply replace Context.</description>

      <description>Introduction It is said that Redux has been overused in some use cases and React context+hooks plays well in such use cases. While I agree with it, Redux should work well in some other situations. Redux should help developing larger apps with many developers. Various libraries in Redux ecosystem should accelerate development. There&amp;rsquo;s another situation in which Redux may help, and that is Web Workers.

      <description>Introduction I have been developing several react hooks libraries. They provide custom hooks for certain purposes. One of them is for web workers. I started it for fun. I got some feedbacks and improved. This post shows the current implementation which aims the use in production.
In this field, Comlink provides a nice transparent API with Proxies. Some might have already tried it with React. I have two reasons why I don&amp;rsquo;t use it for my library.</description>

      <description>Introduction React context and useContext are very handy. You would have no problem using it while developing a small app. If the size of your app became non-trivial, you might experience some performance issues with regard to useContext. This is because useContext will trigger rerender whenever the context value is changed. This happens even if the part of the value is not used in render. This is by design. If useContext were to conditionally trigger rerenders, the hook would become non-composable.</description>

      <description>Motivation I love Redux. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I like all parts of Redux ecosystem. Some people dislike Redux because of its boilerplate code. That&amp;rsquo;s sad. Boilerplate code is not from the Redux core, but from the ecosystem. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong. Best practices are nice and I think the recent work of Redux Starter Kit is great. (Claps to Mark)
I think I have my own understanding of how to use Redux with React.</description>

      <description>Introduction I have been developing several React hooks libraries for months. In this post, I will explain why and how I developed a React Redux binding library with React hooks. The library is implemented to be concurrent mode friendly. Let&amp;rsquo;s discuss why it&amp;rsquo;s important and what&amp;rsquo;s the technique behind it.
React concurrent mode has not come yet, and all discussions are based on the current unstable behavior. Please note that when concurrent mode is released and best practice is researched, things may change.</description>

      <description>Introduction React useContext is very handy to avoid prop drilling. It can be used to define global state or shared state that multiple components in the tree can access.
However, useContext is not specifically designed for global state and there&amp;rsquo;s a caveat. Any change to context value propagates all useContext to re-render components.
This post shows some example code about the problem and the solution with state usage tracking.

      <description>Introduction React hooks have changed the way to compose components. This post will show an example which is very hooks-oriented.
We use two libraries: react-tracked and immer. While immer makes it easy to update state in an immutable way, react-tracked makes it easy to read state with tracking for optimization. Please check out the repo for more details.

      <description>Introduction There are many libraries for global state with React hooks. React Redux also provides hooks API, which is very clean.
In general, I would avoid using global state. It would reduce the isolation of components. Multiple contexts should work fine for certain use cases.
But, what if we really need a global state.
Problem When a state is a non-trivial object, it&amp;rsquo;s not likely to use all properties of the object for one component to render.</description>

      <description>Introduction Since React hooks landed, there has been many libraries proposed for global state. Some of them are simple wrappers around context. Whereas, some of them are full featured state management systems.
Technically, there are several implementations how to store state and notify changes. We don&amp;rsquo;t go in detail in this post, but just note two axes.
 whether context based or external store whether subscriptions based or context propagation  In this post, we focus on API design of hooks at the consumer end.</description>

      <description>Introduction useReducer is a powerful hook. It&amp;rsquo;s known that useState is implemented with useReducer.
In the React hooks docs, it&amp;rsquo;s noted like this:
 useReducer is usually preferable to useState when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one. useReducer also lets you optimize performance for components that trigger deep updates because you can pass dispatch down instead of callbacks.</description>

      <description>Introduction React-Redux provides hooks API with nice abstraction. Especially, useSelector is probaly less misused than mapStateToProps.
react-tracked is a library for global state without Redux. This library provides almost compatible hooks API to React-Redux. It&amp;rsquo;s developed with performance in mind, and it should be as performant as React-Redux, even though it utilizes only React context. See the GitHub repo for more information.

      <description>Introduction There are many libraries to provide global state in React. React itself doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide such a feature, probably because separation of concerns is important and having global state naively is not idiomatic. However, in certain cases, having global state is good as long as it&amp;rsquo;s properly implemented. It&amp;rsquo;s likely that performance drops down compared to using non-global state (incl. multiple contexts).
This post introduces a library for global state with performance.</description>

      <description>Introduction If you had already used Redux and loved it, you might not understand why people try using React context and hooks to replace Redux (a.k.a no Redux hype). For those who would think Redux DevTools Extension and middleware are nice to have, Redux and context + hooks are actually two options. Context + hooks is just fine to share state among components, however if apps get bigger, they are likely to require Redux or other similar solutions; otherwise they end up having many contexts that can&amp;rsquo;t be handled very easily.</description>

      <description>Introduction Global state or shared state is one of the biggest issues when you start developing a React app. Should we use Redux? Do hooks provide a Redux-like solution? I would like to show four patterns toward using Redux. This is my personal opinion and mainly for new apps.
Pattern 1: Prop passing Some might think it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t scale, but the most basic pattern should still be prop passing. If the app is small enough, define local state in a parent component and simply pass it down to child components.</description>

      <description>Introduction Recently, React Redux released hooks API. It&amp;rsquo;s v7.1.0-alpha.4 as of writing.
https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/releases/tag/v7.1.0-alpha.4
On the other hand, I&amp;rsquo;ve been developing a new React Redux binding library with hooks and Proxy.
https://github.com/dai-shi/reactive-react-redux
It&amp;rsquo;s time to benchmark both of them to have better understanding in performance. The reactive-react-redux library utilizes Proxy to auto-detect state usage, hence it technically has overhead which would affect performance. We would like to learn how much it will be affected in a realistic example.</description>

      <guid>https://blog.axlight.com/posts/new-react-redux-coding-style-with-hooks-without-selectors/</guid>
      <description>Introduction React Redux is one of popular web tech stacks. As I found React hooks so promising, I have been developing a hooks-based library for React Redux called &amp;ldquo;reactive-react-redux.&amp;rdquo;
https://github.com/dai-shi/reactive-react-redux
Coding style using this library is mentally different from the official react-redux. Thanks to Proxy, developers don&amp;rsquo;t need to care about optimization, but just focus on composition of logic.
This library provides two basic hooks: useReduxState and useReduxDispatch. This article shows example code how to use them.</description>

const Person = ({ person }) =&amp;gt; ( &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div className=&amp;#34;personFirstName&amp;#34;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span&amp;gt;First Name:&amp;lt;span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span&amp;gt;{person.firstName}&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div className=&amp;#34;personLastName&amp;#34;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span&amp;gt;Last Name:&amp;lt;span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span&amp;gt;{person.lastName}&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; ); Well, this component is a little bit big, so let&amp;rsquo;s split it into functions and compose them.</description>

      <description>Background React 16.8 added a new API, Hooks. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t learned hooks yet, go to the official site and read the entire document before continuing this article.
https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html
Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class. This… reactjs.org This article is about how to create custom hooks for data fetching. As described in the roadmap, React is planning to release react-cache and Suspense for data fetching in the near future.</description>

      <description>Introduction According to React 16.x Roadmap, we are expecting Concurrent Mode soon.
 React 16.x (~Q2 2019): The One with Concurrent Mode Concurrent Mode lets React apps be more responsive by rendering component trees without blocking the main thread. It is opt-in and allows React to interrupt a long-running render (for example, rendering a new feed story) to handle a high-priority event (for example, text input or hover). Concurrent Mode also improves the user experience of Suspense by skipping unnecessary loading states on fast connections.</description>

      <description>Introduction While I don&amp;rsquo;t feel like coding React without hooks, react-cache still seems to be still far away. Surely, caching in data fetching important, nevertheless I would like to seek possibilities of implementations only with React Hooks. These might be obsoleted in the future, but I want something today, that is &amp;ldquo;useFetch&amp;rdquo;. This could be still useful without react-cache in case sophisticated caching is not necessary.
I&amp;rsquo;ve started developing &amp;ldquo;useFetch&amp;rdquo; as a tutorial to build a custom hook.</description>

      <description>Introduction React Hooks is something I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on lately. What&amp;rsquo;s wonderful is creating custom hooks. If you encapsulate logic nicely in a hook, it can be shared among components and used intuitively. You can find my custom hooks in my GitHub repos, some of which are very experimental.
This time, my experiment is to combine React Hooks and Web Workers. I know it&amp;rsquo;s not too difficult, but let me explain a bit in this short article.</description>

      <guid>https://blog.axlight.com/posts/a-thought-on-react-context-default-value/</guid>
      <description>Introduction It&amp;rsquo;s been about a year since React Context API is out. This is powerful and it&amp;rsquo;s even more powerful with upcoming React Hooks API, namely useContext. Please check out official documents to learn them in detail.
https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html
https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html
Now, this very short article is just about the default value of a context. When you create a context, you pass a default value in the first argument.
 The defaultValue argument is only used when a component does not have a matching Provider above it in the tree.</description>

      <title>Developing React custom hooks for abortable async functions with AbortController</title>

      <guid>https://blog.axlight.com/posts/developing-react-custom-hooks-for-abortable-async-functions-with-abortcontroller/</guid>
      <description>In my previous article, I introduced how the custom hook useAsyncTask handles async functions with AbortController and demonstrated a typeahead search example. In this article, I explain about the implementation of useAsyncTask.
Recap JavaScript promise is not abortable. The fetch API is based on promise, and hence you can&amp;rsquo;t cancel it in pure JavaScript. To cancel fetch, the DOM spec introduced AbortController. The AbortController is a general interface and not specific to fetch.</description>

      <title>Developing React custom hooks for Redux without react-redux</title>

      <description>Background Ever since I learned Redux, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking an alternative integration of react and redux to the official react-redux library. The intuition behind it is that Redux is super simple which I like a lot, whereas react-redux is complex because of performance tuning. If you are developing a business product, the official react-redux is to go without a doubt, but if you are playing with creating a toy app or you are just starting learning Redux, you might want something more straightforward.</description>

      <description>There is a follow-up article which describes the implementation details of the library. Please visit here.
 TL;DR Just visit the example in codesandbox and try it.
Background You can&amp;rsquo;t cancel promises in JavaScript and that&amp;rsquo;s one of the reason why libraries such as redux-saga and redux-observables are popular because they allow cancellation. While they are good solutions as well as Redux is, there might be a case when you want just a cancellation mechanism for a promise, not the entire framework.</description>

      <description>This article shows the steps to create a minimal Expo project. The project uses TypeScript and Jest. Note that this procedure is based on Expo SDK31 and may be invalid in the future.
Install Expo CLI As described in the official doc, let&amp;rsquo;s install the CLI tool.
$ npm install -g expo-cli  Note: I prefer using npx and I use npx in my project, but expo-cli depends on @expo/dev-tools which depends on old graphql.</description>

      <guid>https://blog.axlight.com/posts/react-hooks-tutorial-on-developing-a-custom-hook-for-data-fetching/</guid>
      <description>Introduction React Hooks are a new feature coming in React 16.7. It allows us to write stateful function components that were impossible before without class components. The official docs are must-read, so check them out if you haven&amp;rsquo;t.
https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html
Besides stateful function components, this new feature allow us to build a custom hook to share logic between components. This has been possible with High-order Components (HoCs), and although there&amp;rsquo;s technically no difference what hooks can achieve, hooks simplify it a lot and reduce so called &amp;ldquo;wrapper hell&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>There is a follow-up article which describes the implementation details of this library. Please visit here.
 Redux is one of the popular libraries for React. Although Redux itself is not tied to React, it&amp;rsquo;s often used with the official bindings react-redux that allows to connect Redux state to any React components.
In this article, we propose another bindings library to combine React and Redux. This library tries to be simple and easy for beginners.</description>

      <description>In this article, I will first explain minimal code to implement global state with useReducer and useContext which are called &amp;ldquo;hooks&amp;rdquo; that will be available in React 16.7. I will then compare it with react-hooks-global-state which is a tiny library that I&amp;rsquo;ve been developing for global state management primarily for small applications.
Note: Global state is convenient for sharing values among components far apart in the component tree, but it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be abused because it would limit the reusability.</description>

      <description>Note: this post has nothing to do with React Hooks API.
In my previous post, I introduced a library called react-context-global-state. After a while, I have better knowlege of TypeScript (yes, I&amp;rsquo;m a beginner!), and come up with fairly good type definitions. I just released a new version.
https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-context-global-state
Example code in TypeScript Let me breifly show how the code looks like in TypeScript.
In a file named state.ts, we define a global state and export function components.</description>

Please also check out my previous posts [1] [2].
Support for Redux middleware Originally, the library was extending useState for global state. Later, reducer is supported.</description>

      <description>Motivation Everyone is excited about the new React Hooks API. So am I. Having been thinking how to manage global state, the Hooks API seems promising. By the way, I like Redux a lot, but I don&amp;rsquo;t like react-redux a.k.a connect very much. It is too complicated for beginners to use it properly. For example, reselect / memoization is a hard concept to explain. My recommendation is to structure a global state so that mapStateToProps only needs to select a part of the state without any logic.</description>

      <description>React Hooks API is a new proposal for React v16.7. It enables writing all components as functions with full functionality. You can develop &amp;ldquo;custom hooks&amp;rdquo; to add a new functionality. Although it&amp;rsquo;s not released yet, I would like to introduce a new library to support global state. Note that it&amp;rsquo;s still an experiment.
The library It&amp;rsquo;s called &amp;ldquo;react-hooks-global-state&amp;rdquo; and is available in npm. Please also checkout the GitHub repository.

      <description>Motivation Have you heard of React Native, GraphQL and TypeScript? I&amp;rsquo;m looking for a easy and nice tech stack to develop mobile apps. These three may fit nicely for developing mobile apps for beginners up to intermediates. More precisely, Expo is chosen for building React Native development environment, and React Apollo is for GraphQL. These libraries comes with type annotations, which allow us to code in TypeScript. By &amp;ldquo;Clean&amp;rdquo; I mean not only the boilerplate is minimalistic, but also we don&amp;rsquo;t allow &amp;ldquo;any&amp;rdquo; types.</description>

      <description>I had been trying to find a way to use React without using class. Redux is one solution to achieve this. Although I love the idea of writing everthing in pure functions, Redux is sometimes not suitable for small apps. React v16.3 introduced new Context API officially. Since then, several ideas were proposed to use it for managing global state. So far, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to find something I really liked, hence I made a new one.</description>
