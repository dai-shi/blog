		<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>In this post, I would like to reflect on my journey in open source software development.</p>
<h3 id="my-first-oss-contribution">My first OSS contribution</h3>
<p>Around the year 2000, I made my first contribution to OSS: an Ethernet driver for NetBSD/mac68k. It was written in C, and now, looking back, I can barely understand the code.</p>
<p>Found this link on the Web:</p>
<p><a href="http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/src/sys/arch/mac68k/nubus/if_netdock_nubus.c?rev=1.35&amp;content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup">http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/src/sys/arch/mac68k/nubus/if_netdock_nubus.c?rev=1.35&amp;content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup</a></p>
<h3 id="chicken-scheme">Chicken Scheme</h3>
<p>Another phase in my OSS journey was working with Scheme. Although my contributions were small, I did contribute to a few libraries.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one of them:</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/5/crc">https://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/5/crc</a></p>
<h3 id="javascript">JavaScript</h3>
<p>In 2012, my first JavaScript library was open-sourced. I have been using GitHub since then.</p>
<p>Link:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dai-shi/continuation.js">https://github.com/dai-shi/continuation.js</a></p>
<p>It was a library that aimed to bring some Scheme flavor to JavaScript, although I eventually had to give up on fully implementing all the features I wanted.</p>
<p>After that, I developed several libraries for Node.js, especially for Express.js.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dai-shi/social-cms-backend">https://github.com/dai-shi/social-cms-backend</a></p>
<p>During this period, I sent patches to some OSS projects like JSDOM.</p>
<p>Although my primary focus was on libraries, I also developed some small apps.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dai-shi/codeonmobile">https://github.com/dai-shi/codeonmobile</a></p>
<p>This one was built with Angular.js.</p>
<h3 id="meteor">Meteor</h3>
<p>In 2015, I shifted my focus to Meteor.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dai-shi/meteor-blaze-google-maps">https://github.com/dai-shi/meteor-blaze-google-maps</a></p>
<p>It was around this time that I switched to using MIT license, having previously used BSD license.</p>
<h3 id="react">React</h3>
<p>In 2016, I started developing React libraries.</p>
<p>I believe this was the first one:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dai-shi/react-compose-state">https://github.com/dai-shi/react-compose-state</a></p>
<p>This was likely the start of my journey to global state management. I wanted to use state with function components. But, Redux was too much for some (most?) cases. Nobody used this library. People used recompose.</p>
<p>There are more libraries I developed, but unfortunately none of them got much attention.</p>
<h3 id="react-hooks">React Hooks</h3>
<p>In 2018, React Hooks was announced. I felt it was the perfect time to develop something based on this new concept. I took this opportunity seriously, and started to put most of my time on it.</p>
<p>One of my new activities was writing blog posts. It was good to get attention and feedback.</p>
<p>My interest in React Hooks was mainly in two fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>Global state management with concurrent mode in mind</li>
<li>Suspense for data fetching</li>
</ul>
<p>I developed numerous libraries during this period, some of which are still actively maintained and used in production.</p>
<h3 id="poimandres">Poimandres</h3>
<p>In 2020, I joined the Poimandres developer collective, where I started developing Zustand, Jotai, and Valtio.</p>
<p>Read more in my other blog posts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.axlight.com/posts/how-zustand-was-born/">https://blog.axlight.com/posts/how-zustand-was-born/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://blog.axlight.com/posts/how-jotai-was-born/">https://blog.axlight.com/posts/how-jotai-was-born/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://blog.axlight.com/posts/how-valtio-was-born/">https://blog.axlight.com/posts/how-valtio-was-born/</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="current-status">Current Status</h3>
<p>Currently, I&rsquo;m basically a full-time open source developer. However, I still need to do freelance work to pay the bills, as my sponsorships aren&rsquo;t enough yet. Earning enough to focus solely on open source is my next goal.</p>
<p>Another goal of mine is to evolve the ecosystem with the community. I can maintain the small parts, for example the Jotai core, but I need collaborators to maintain the whole ecosystem, such as Jotai integration libraries. Organizing the community is a big challenge for me.</p>
